**Barbara A. Caspers** is a Professor of Behavioural Ecology at Bielefeld University, where she leads research into the function and mechanisms of chemical communication in vertebrates, with a special focus on olfactory kin recognition in birds and mammals. Originally trained on olfactory communication in sac‑winged bats during her PhD, she has since investigated scent-based nest and familial recognition in zebra finches, fire salamanders, blue tits, and Antarctic fur seals.
