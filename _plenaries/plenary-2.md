Laura is a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow and Associate Professor. She is a sensory ecologist and her research broadly focuses on how animals use their senses to interpret the world and how this shapes the production, perception and evolution of signals. Her current research investigates how animal visual signals can exploit perceptual processes during mate choice and predator-prey interactions, for example by creating visual illusions. Laura primarily works on birds (great bowerbirds and herring gulls), swordtail fish and various invertebrates. For up to date information, please visit her website www.laurakelleyresearch.com.


Laura is a member of the Exeter Visual Ecology Group and the Behaviour research group.
