## Outreach Lecture 2025

**Innes Cuthill** is a Professor of Behavioural Ecology at the University of Bristol. He wears two hats, behavioural ecologist and sensory ecologist, although the unifying theme is the explanation of the factors shaping the design, through natural selection, of animal form and function. His current main research area involves collaborating closely with physiologists, perceptual psychologists and computational neuroscientists to understand how animal coloration (notably camouflage) evolves in response to animal colour vision.
