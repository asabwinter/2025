**Amanda D. Melin** is a Professor of Biological Anthropology and a Canada Research Chair in dietary ecology and genomics at the University of Calgary. Her integrative research explores how primates use their senses — particularly vision and smell — to locate and select foods, adapt to seasonal resource shifts, and engage with microbial symbionts. Co‑director of the Santa Rosa Primate Project in Costa Rica and with active field sites in Borneo and Puerto Rico, she blends behavioural ecology, molecular genetics, stable isotope analysis and computational vision modelling.
