**Amanda D. Melin** is a Professor of Biological Anthropology and a Canada Research Chair in dietary ecology and genomics at the University of Calgary. She unites behavioural and ecological study of animals in wild contexts with new and emerging methods in the ‘omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome) to study sensory systems, digestion and health of mammals, including humans. Broadly speaking she seeks to understand how animals find, assess and digest foods, and how changing environments affect animal diets, microbiomes, and parasites. She is also actively researching the genetic basis and 'omic correlates of age-related visual diseases, such as glaucoma.
