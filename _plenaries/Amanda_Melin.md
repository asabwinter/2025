**Amanda D. Melin** is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and Archaeology and Medical Genetics at the University of Calgary, holding a Canada Research Chair in Sensory Ecology. Her integrative research explores how primates use their senses—particularly vision and smell—to locate and select foods, adapt to seasonal resource shifts, and engage with microbial symbionts. Co‑director of the Santa Rosa Primate Project in Costa Rica and active field sites in Borneo and Puerto Rico, she blends behavioural ecology, molecular genetics, stable isotope analysis and computational vision modelling. Melin has received numerous awards including the Killam Emerging Research Leader Award, the American Society of Primatologists Early Career Achievement Award, and University of Calgary teaching honours.
