# ASAB Winter Conference website

Developed by Jolyon Troscianko in 2025, taking content from the previous year's github-based site: https://asabwinter2024.github.io/, and using the website repository: academicpages.github.io-master

## Future ASAB Winter conference organisers (or anyone else) - feel free to copy this site and adjust for your own conference

This site can read and format content using markdown files, so you can probably just adjsut all the code on Github directly. Create new .md files for each of your organisers and plenary speakers. Drop the relevant images in the images directory and update the links (see an existing version for formatting).

Adjust the content of the pages found in _pages (about.md is the homepage)
Add plenary speakers (each with their own .md file) in _pleanaries
Add organising committee members likewise in _organisers
Adjust the menu bar by editing _data/navigation.yml
Replace the banner image with your own in images/header-bg.jpg (800px by ~184 pixels)
Other main site settings are found in _config.yml
