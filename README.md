# ASAB Winter Conference website

Developed by Jolyon Troscianko in 2025, taking content from the [previous year's github-based site](https://asabwinter2024.github.io/), and using the Jekyll [academicpages website repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) (which has an MIT license), itself forked from [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

## Future ASAB Winter conference organisers (or anyone else) - simply fork (make a copy of) this site and adjust for your own conference

This site can read and format content using markdown files, so you can probably just adjust all the code on Github directly. Create new .md files for each of your organisers and plenary speakers. Just copy the format of existing md files (leave the header info at the top of the file). Drop the relevant images in the images directory and update the links (see an existing version for formatting).

- Adjust the content of the pages found in _pages (about.md is the homepage)
- Add plenary speakers (each with their own .md file) in _pleanaries
- Add organising committee members likewise in _organisers
- Adjust the menu bar by editing _data/navigation.yml
- Replace the banner image with your own in images/header-bg.jpg (800px by ~184 pixels)
- Other main site settings are found in _config.yml
