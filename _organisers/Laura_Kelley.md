**Laura Kelley** is an Associate Professor and Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow at the University of Exeter’s Cornwall (Penryn) Campus. Her interdisciplinary research focuses on animal perception, cognition, and behaviour, exploring how sensory systems shape interactions—from how gulls use human cues while foraging in urban environments to sensory deception in bowerbird courtship, visual illusions in moths and butterflies, and categorical perception in swordtail fish. Kelley's work, anchored within Exeter’s Visual Ecology and Centre for Ecology and Conservation groups, is funded by the Royal Society, ERC, NERC, and other bodies. In addition, she advocates for inclusivity and gender equality as an active member of her college’s Athena Swan committee.

Laura is a member of the Exeter Visual Ecology Group and the Behaviour research group.
