**Laura Kelley** is an Associate Professor and Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow at the University of Exeter’s Cornwall (Penryn) Campus. Her interdisciplinary research focuses on animal perception, cognition, and behaviour, exploring how sensory systems shape interactions — from sensory deception and illusions in courtship and predator-prey interactions, to how gulls use human cues while foraging in urban environments, and non-linear perception in during mate choice in swordtail fish.
