**Innes C. Cuthill** is Professor of Behavioural Ecology in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol. His research spans sensory ecology and evolutionary biology, focusing on how animal coloration—especially camouflage and warning signals—evolves in response to predator visual systems and perceptual mechanisms. He has made seminal contributions to understanding aposematism, countershading, iridescent camouflage, and the perceptual ecology of movement and symmetry in prey detection. Educated at Cambridge (B.A. Natural Sciences) and Oxford (D.Phil.), he became Bristol faculty in 1989 and a full professor in 1998. Cuthill has published over 250 articles, helped develop ARRIVE guidelines for animal research reporting, and earned numerous awards including the Zoological Society of London’s Scientific Medal and the ASAB Medal.
